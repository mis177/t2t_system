# t2t_system


## Features
Simplified navigation using phone sensors and flutter_map (https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_map).

User facing direction is determined by accelerometer and magnetometer values.

## Getting started

Download and run project on your device.


## Usage

Clicking on the map creates a route with user position set in first point.
Moving forward and backward by default is based on phone tilt (X axis). Higher the tilt, higher user speed.

Additional option is moving by hinting direction of movement by phone tilt (X axis) and using accelerometer values as moving speed.
